•	 Gathered daily data of exchange rate of Indian Rupee from 2010 to 2019, cleaned and pre-processed data.<br>
•	 Forecasted currency exchange rate of INR with respect to USD for approximately 3 years.<br>
•	 Accomplished a model to analyze exchange rates using time series analysis models such as basic forecasting techniques (mean, naïve, seasonal naïve and drift) to advanced techniques (SES, Holt, ARIMA) and it was established that Holt’s model was best fit for prediction.
